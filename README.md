1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

The best option would be to run the tests within a Github action whenever new code is pushed. This allows bugs to be caught early and as a result, provides feedback and ensures consistent testing with everyone involved.

2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output?

No, it would not be ideal because end-to-end testing is more for testing the entire program from start to finish, not necessarily individual functions.

3. What is the difference between navigation and snapshot mode?

Snapshot mode puts more focus on the user and good developement practices in the code. For instance, it gave me an error that I was html tag without a "lang" attribute. On the other hand, navigation did not seem to care about these as much. While some errors did mention these issues, it still gave the website a really good score in categories such as "best practices". 

4. Name three things we could do to improve the CSE 110 shop site based on the Lighthouse results.
   Three things that we could do to improve the CSE 110 shop site based on the lighthouse results would be to compress images to save load time, include a lang attribute for accessibility, for specifically internationalization, and include a meta tag with viewport to optimize the app for mobile screen sizes.
